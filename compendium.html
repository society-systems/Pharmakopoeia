			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">Below you will find the first iteration of an open access ‘Trans-millenial Compendium’ that acts as an accretive pharmacopoeia, a formulary of shared remedies not only for bodies and space but also for systems of knowledge and unlearning. The ‘Trans-millennial Compendium’ will be updated with new entries every month, starting May 2021. 
			</p>
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">The over-arching methodology adopted in this preparation, collation and polychronic concoction is indisciplinary, i.e. rather than claiming to trespass the orders of discipline as promised in the trans-disciplinary approach and instead of positing to be working in an imaginary in-between space constituted within certain branches of knowledge, as broadly suggested by the inter-disciplinary approach, this compendium seeks to critically investigate how learning environments are distinctively arranged, tamed and delineated in multiple disciplinary frameworks of power and diffusion. My frames of reference range across the fields of environmental history, history of science and magic, techno-feminist sci-fi, STS, medical anthropology, medicine, art, literature, sound, computer science, media studies, STS, philosophy of science, medicine and technology. All references are for the time being text- and web-based, as well as talismanic. They seek to present a palimpsestic hybridity that ranges from books to ancient manuscripts, pharmacopoeia, talismans, web platforms and essays.

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold centered">
			In her very compelling, self-reflexive essay ‘Diseases from Dust: Quarantining Women and the masking of History’ published in Arabic in the most recent issue of <a href="http://www.rustedradishes.com/" target="blank">‘Rusted Radishes: Beirut Literary and Art Journal’</a>, writer, social worker and medical anthropologist Lamia Moghnieh probes how great confinements and rumours circulating around disease in the history of psychiatry and viral outbreaks in Lebanon are formed by the structural venom of sectarianism, racism and sexism within society. Deeply committed to a multidisciplinary approach that I would even argue is, in fact, profoundly indisplinary, Lamia Moghnieh situates her feminist research at the intersection of critical medical anthropology, the history of science and society and ‘Middle East’ history. In parallel with sharing findings from her archival research in the collected records of the Lebanon Hospital for Mental and Nervous Disorders—popularly known as Asfourieyh Hospital (1901-1982), Lamia returns to her own situated voice, body and encounters with disease and technologically mediated personal fears that were spurred by the dusts of the archive and reductively misdiagnosed by the medical system. Can history, in its exilic yet reoccurring ghastliness and comorbid mis-aetiologies, make us ill?

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold centered">I find a great affinity and serendipitous kinship with the newly encountered work of scholar Liana Saif and my previous ventures into the history of Abbasid sciences and uncanny philosophy. So I hope to converse with her soon. Liana’s research focuses on Islamic esotericism and the occult sciences, with a special interest in the exchange of esoteric and occult knowledge between the Islamic and Latin ecumenes. Liana’s 2015 book ‘The Arabic Influences on Early Modern Occult Philosophy’ was also deeply informative for my research. You can download Liana’s essay ‘Between Medicine and Magic: Spiritual Aetiology and Therapeutics in Medieval Islam’ over <a href="hhttps://www.academia.edu/31583252/Between_Medicine_and_Magic_Spiritual_Aetiology_and_Therapeutics_in_Medieval_Islam" target="blank">here</a>.

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold centered">The oldest pharmacopoeia known to date is Ancient Egyptian, dating back to 1600 BC, yet it is still, until today, called ‘Edward Smith Papyrus’. It is a treatise on how to treat 48 cases of injuries, fractures, wounds, dislocations and tumors. Mr. Edward Smith obviously didn’t write it, he was a 19th century dealer and collector of antiquities who bought the medical papyrus in 1862 and called it by his name. During my research, I witnessed these colonial, kleptocratic politics of attribution in the presentations and historicizations of several pharmacopoeia which I would like to further delve into and decolonize in the ensuing chapters of this project. They are also at the core of many European medieval and 18th-19th century practices of corpse medicine and the like.

The taste and smell of a patient’s urine were affected by the illness they were suffering from, and generally corresponded with specific colors.

The more theatrical and dramatic operation by which healing takes place - or does not take place - has a name:. transference. Now transference is still repetition: above all it is repetition. If repetition makes us ill, it also heals us; if it enchains and destroys us, it also frees us, testifying in both cases to its ‘demonic’ power. All cure is a voyage to the bottom of repetition. There is indeed something analogous to scientific experimentation in transference, since the patient is supposed to repeat the whole of his disturbance in privileged, artificial conditions, taking the person of the analyst as ‘object’. In transference, however, repetition does not so much serve to identify events, persons and passions as to authenticate the roles and select the masks.’

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold centered">‘I find it odious the way doctors manipulate power, and they are odious – as doctors, they are odious. I have a great hatred, not for individual doctors – on the contrary, they can be charming --, but I have hatred for medical power and the way doctors use this medical power. There is only one thing that thrilled me – and at the same time, it displeased them – is when it would happen that they used their machines and tests on me. I consider these to be very unpleasant for a patient since you get the impression that these tests really seem completely useless, except to make the doctors feel better about or confirm their diagnoses. But if they are doctors with all this talent and they already have their diagnoses, and these cruel tests only serve to make them feel better, then they are playing with these tests in an inadmissible way. So what made me quite happy was when, each time I had to be tested under one of their machines – that is, my breath was too weak to register on their machines, or they weren't able to give me a sonogram [échographie] – well, they couldn’t give it to me because I passed under their machine, and to my complete delight, they just got furious with me. At these moments, I think they hate their poor patient, because they could accept quite easily the fact that their diagnosis might be wrong, but they cannot accept at all that their machine wouldn't work on me. Otherwise, I consider them to be far too uncultivated, or when they attempt to be cultivated, the results are catastrophic. They are very strange people, doctors, but my consolation is that if they earn a lot of money, they don't have time really to spend it, they don’t have the time to take advantage of it because they lead a very hard life. So it's true, I do not find doctors very attractive, except for the individual personalities which can be quite exquisite. Yet they really treat people like dogs in their official functions. So it really reveals class struggle because if one is a little bit 66 wealthy, they are a lot more polite, except in surgery. Surgeons are a different case altogether. So, doctors really are a problem, and some kind of reform of doctors is needed.’

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold centered">‘One of the problems with healing in this fucked-up world is that it’s presumed that you, the doctor, have a set of knowledges that the patient doesn’t, so for the patient to get better, to be cured, or to heal, they must submit themselves to Doctor’s Orders. In other words, I’m supposed to wholly, absolutely give my trust to you—but not because you’ve demonstrated any action that would earn my trust, specifically, or because we’ve gone through the stages of intimacy and equal exchange together. It’s that you represent a discipline that is supposed to be deserving of trust; I’m supposed to trust you simply because you are a doctor.</p>
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold centered">To us patients, this dynamic feels like one in which we are helpless because it is. It feels one-sided, dangerously unequal. I have to give my trust to you, but not because you’ve earned it. It’s because you work in the hospital, or the clinic, a place that is a metonym for medical expertise; it’s because you speak in the coded language of medicine and wear the white lab coat, a rehearsed performance with its attendant costume. I don’t feel like you trust me, because you are treating me, or parts of me, as enemies to be vanquished. I’m told things like: “We’ve got to get these symptoms under control,” “We’ve got to beat this thing.” It’s framed as an exercise of domination, an attempt at mastery. But the body and the mind are not places for domination and mastery.’

I always share it with friends and acquaintances who work in the medical field, and I wholeheartedly wish I can also read it to Deleuze’s ghost – to speak not only of transference, which is a very hard task for many of us, the intransferable and what machines cannot read but also of the alienation and antagonism that the medical system often produces. In this epistolary essay, Johanna taught me, time and time again, how the way to justice and the way to healing might be the same.

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">If you want to read about the development of the presently resurgent image of  the immune system as an army defending the body against foreign invaders, medical anthropologist Emily Martin critically analyses the development of this militarised representation of health in her seminal 1994 book, <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8070-4626-5" target="blank">‘Flexible Bodies: Tracking Immunity in American Culture from the Days of Polio to the Age of AIDS’</a>.</p>
			
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">Martin observes ‘a new model of immunity emerging among conventional scientists, holistic practitioners and the public, according to which the immune system is thought of as a ‘field' whose dysfunctions contribute to allergies, cancer, heart disease and AIDS. But a corollary of this emergent view of the body as a complex, constantly changing system, she maintains, is the notion that some people are more ‘flexible’ than others who are less adaptable. ``Flexibility'' is coming to be valued more highly than the individual, in Martin's analysis, and this underlies a disturbing new Social Darwinism.’

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">‘Institutions are environments. Institutions operate both socially and environmentally, in regimes that are both signifying and a-signifying. Exploring institutions' potential for emancipation and empowerment requires understanding them within a semiotic framework which does not reduce institutional relations to linguistic exchanges. This understanding is particularly important if we want to think about how institutions participate in the production of subjectivity, and how they can potentiate or hinder processes of emancipation. The meaning and practice of militancy requires continuous reassessment.’ Throughout her work, researcher Susana Caló has focused on alternatives to mental health care which promote collective practices of care. To complement Caló’s urgent essay from 2019 and concurrently return to the ULTRASANITY project, I highly recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIhomKWLZik" target="blank">this presentation by Dora García</a> beginning with a very poignant testimony by student and organiser Carmen Roll around the common dissonance between theory and praxis, ethics and aesthetics following her experience with Felix Guattari and his refusal to dance.
