			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">Below you will find the first iteration of an open access ‘Trans-millenial Compendium’ that acts as an accretive pharmacopoeia, a formulary of shared remedies not only for bodies and space but also for systems of knowledge and unlearning. The ‘Trans-millennial Compendium’ will be updated with new entries every month, starting May 2021. 
			</p>
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">The over-arching methodology adopted in this preparation, collation and polychronic concoction is indisciplinary, i.e. rather than claiming to trespass the orders of discipline as promised in the trans-disciplinary approach and instead of positing to be working in an imaginary in-between space constituted within certain branches of knowledge, as broadly suggested by the inter-disciplinary approach, this compendium seeks to critically investigate how learning environments are distinctively arranged, tamed and delineated in multiple disciplinary frameworks of power and diffusion. My frames of reference range across the fields of environmental history, history of science and magic, techno-feminist sci-fi, STS, medical anthropology, medicine, art, literature, sound, computer science, media studies, STS, philosophy of science, medicine and technology. All references are for the time being text- and web-based, as well as talismanic. They seek to present a palimpsestic hybridity that ranges from books to ancient manuscripts, pharmacopoeia, talismans, web platforms and essays.  
			</p>
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">Below, you will find the introductory entries of May 2021. If you would like to stay up to date with the development of the compendium, please write to <a href="mailto:society@posteo.si" target="_top">society@posteo.si</a>.</p>

			<h1>LISTEN TO YOUR CONFUSION</h1>
			<h2>THE SCORE:</h2>
			<h2>Listen to your confusion</h2>
			
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">Listen to any rumbling thoughts that you have but you might <br>
				not usually not give them much time <br>
				because they are not well formulated or they don't make much sense.<br>
				From personal doubts about who you are in relation to others <br>
				to general anxieties in regards to our times. <br>
				<br>
				Articulate this confusion in whatever way you can in any language you want <br>
				without being scared but feeling comfortable enough<br>
				to share with others.<br>
				You can record it with your mobile and send to mattin@mattin.org, either with your name or anonymously. <br>
				This exercise can also be done collectively.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">‘Listen to your Confusion’ is an exercise by noise artist and writer Mattin
 				produced in the context of his collective work with the PAN-PAN Kolektiva in Spain (https://panpankolektiva.org/). PAN-PAN is the international standard urgency signal, meaning Pay Attention Now. Although PAN-PAN does not denote immediate danger, it is used in navigation and flights to indicate situations that may become truly dangerous. We have adopted this signal as our name since the current COVID-19 crisis is ‘truly dangerous’, deeply affecting our way of perceiving and thinking.
			</p>
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">You can find more about the exercise in ‘Archivo de la confusión’ (https://www.museoreinasofia.es/content/archivo_de_la_confusion) microsite, developed by the PAN-PAN Kolektiva and hosted on the website of the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid. On the microsite, you will also find other exercises that the PAN-PAN Kolektiva has been producing and collecting. These exercises dynamically and critically probe and resist the neoliberalization of the spiritual turn in this paranoid age of increased political polarisation and conspirutualism.</p>

Medieval doctors in Europe used urine charts as diagnostic guide for all sorts of ailments. Some historians of medicine assume that the physicians of the Middle Ages also relied on their sense of taste and smell for medical identification. The taste and smell of a patient’s urine were affected by the illness they were suffering from, and generally corresponded with specific colors.

			<h2>82349082340</h2>
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">‘I find it odious the way doctors manipulate power, and they are odious – as doctors, they are odious. I have a great hatred, not for individual doctors – on the contrary, they can be charming --, but I have hatred for medical power and the way doctors use this medical power. There is only one thing that thrilled me – and at the same time, it displeased them – is when it would happen that they used their machines and tests on me. I consider these to be very unpleasant for a patient since you get the impression that these tests really seem completely useless, except to make the doctors feel better about or confirm their diagnoses. But if they are doctors with all this talent and they already have their diagnoses, and these cruel tests only serve to make them feel better, then they are playing with these tests in an inadmissible way. So what made me quite happy was when, each time I had to be tested under one of their machines – that is, my breath was too weak to register on their machines, or they weren't able to give me a sonogram [échographie] – well, they couldn’t give it to me because I passed under their machine, and to my complete delight, they just got furious with me. At these moments, I think they hate their poor patient, because they could accept quite easily the fact that their diagnosis might be wrong, but they cannot accept at all that their machine wouldn't work on me. Otherwise, I consider them to be far too uncultivated, or when they attempt to be cultivated, the results are catastrophic. They are very strange people, doctors, but my consolation is that if they earn a lot of money, they don't have time really to spend it, they don’t have the time to take advantage of it because they lead a very hard life. So it's true, I do not find doctors very attractive, except for the individual personalities which can be quite exquisite. Yet they really treat people like dogs in their official functions. So it really reveals class struggle because if one is a little bit 66 wealthy, they are a lot more polite, except in surgery. Surgeons are a different case altogether. So, doctors really are a problem, and some kind of reform of doctors is needed.’

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">‘One of the problems with healing in this fucked-up world is that it’s presumed that you, the doctor, have a set of knowledges that the patient doesn’t, so for the patient to get better, to be cured, or to heal, they must submit themselves to Doctor’s Orders. In other words, I’m supposed to wholly, absolutely give my trust to you—but not because you’ve demonstrated any action that would earn my trust, specifically, or because we’ve gone through the stages of intimacy and equal exchange together. It’s that you represent a discipline that is supposed to be deserving of trust; I’m supposed to trust you simply because you are a doctor.</p>
			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">To us patients, this dynamic feels like one in which we are helpless because it is. It feels one-sided, dangerously unequal. I have to give my trust to you, but not because you’ve earned it. It’s because you work in the hospital, or the clinic, a place that is a metonym for medical expertise; it’s because you speak in the coded language of medicine and wear the white lab coat, a rehearsed performance with its attendant costume. I don’t feel like you trust me, because you are treating me, or parts of me, as enemies to be vanquished. I’m told things like: “We’ve got to get these symptoms under control,” “We’ve got to beat this thing.” It’s framed as an exercise of domination, an attempt at mastery. But the body and the mind are not places for domination and mastery.’

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">This is an excerpt from ‘Letter to a Young Doctor’, an incisive document of emergent care on the terms of engagement between patient and doctor written by my dear friend and interlocutor, writer, musician and astrologer Johanna Hedva. I always share it with friends and acquaintances who work in the medical field, and I wholeheartedly wish I can also read it to Deleuze’s ghost – to speak not only of transference, which is a very hard task for many of us, the intransferable and what machines cannot read but also of the alienation and antagonism that the medical system often produces. In this epistolary essay, Johanna taught me, time and time again, how the way to justice and the way to healing might be the same. For those who haven’t read it, I highly recommend also reading Hedva’s ‘Sick Woman Theory’ where they expound on this interlink writing,

			‘The most anti-capitalist protest is to care for another and to care for yourself. To take on the historically feminized and therefore invisible practice of nursing, nurturing, caring. To take seriously each other’s vulnerability and fragility and precarity, and to support it, honor it, empower it. To protect each other, to enact and practice community. A radical kinship, an interdependent sociality, a politics of care.’

			<p class="bright-text sans-bold">If you want to read about the development of the presently resurgent image of  the immune system as an army defending the body against foreign invaders, medical anthropologist Emily Martin critically analyses the development of this militarised representation of health in her seminal 1994 book, <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8070-4626-5" target="blank">‘Flexible Bodies: Tracking Immunity in American Culture from the Days of Polio to the Age of AIDS’</a>.</p>
			
			<p class="bright-text">Martin observes ‘a new model of immunity emerging among conventional scientists, holistic practitioners and the public, according to which the immune system is thought of as a ‘field' whose dysfunctions contribute to allergies, cancer, heart disease and AIDS. But a corollary of this emergent view of the body as a complex, constantly changing system, she maintains, is the notion that some people are more ‘flexible’ than others who are less adaptable. ``Flexibility'' is coming to be valued more highly than the individual, in Martin's analysis, and this underlies a disturbing new Social Darwinism.’
