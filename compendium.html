			<h1>LISTEN TO YOUR CONFUSION</h1>
			<h2>THE SCORE:</h2>
			<h2>Listen to your confusion</h2>
			
			<p class="bright-text">Listen to any rumbling thoughts that you have but you might <br>
				not usually not give them much time <br>
				because they are not well formulated or they don't make much sense.<br>
				From personal doubts about who you are in relation to others <br>
				to general anxieties in regards to our times. <br>
				<br>
				Articulate this confusion in whatever way you can in any language you want <br>
				without being scared but feeling comfortable enough<br>
				to share with others.<br>
				You can record it with your mobile and send to mattin@mattin.org, either with your name or anonymously. <br>
				This exercise can also be done collectively.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="bright-text">‘Listen to your Confusion’ is an exercise by noise artist and writer Mattin
 				produced in the context of his collective work with the PAN-PAN Kolektiva in Spain (https://panpankolektiva.org/). PAN-PAN is the international standard urgency signal, meaning Pay Attention Now. Although PAN-PAN does not denote immediate danger, it is used in navigation and flights to indicate situations that may become truly dangerous. We have adopted this signal as our name since the current COVID-19 crisis is ‘truly dangerous’, deeply affecting our way of perceiving and thinking.
			</p>
			<p class="bright-text">You can find more about the exercise in ‘Archivo de la confusión’ (https://www.museoreinasofia.es/content/archivo_de_la_confusion) microsite, developed by the PAN-PAN Kolektiva and hosted on the website of the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid. On the microsite, you will also find other exercises that the PAN-PAN Kolektiva has been producing and collecting. These exercises dynamically and critically probe and resist the neoliberalization of the spiritual turn in this paranoid age of increased political polarisation and conspirutualism.</p>

			<p class="bright-text">Pages from two manuscript copies from ‘شموس الانوار وكنوز الاسرار Shumūs al-anwār wa-kunūz al-asrār / The Suns of Luminescences and the Treasures of Secrets’ written in 1338 by Ibn Al-Hajjaj Al-Talismani on the preparation of talismans, astrological charts and spells. The book has been circulating in several manuscripts for 7 centuries, though it is currently prohibited under some legislations in West Asia and North Africa. A very active online community exists around it – fugitively and not so fugitively. You can find a full pdf of one of the manuscript copies currently stored at the McGill Library and made accessible as a digital scan on <a href="https://ia801604.us.archive.org/25/items/McGillLibrary-rbsc_isl_shumus_BF1608A7I131874-16700/rbsc_isl_shumus_BF1608A7I131874.pdf" target="blank">Internet Archive</a>.

			<p class="bright-text">In search for a new queer feminist language, Monique Wittig thoroughly subverts medical lexica in her experimental novel ‘The Lesbian Body’(1973). By eroticizing medical names of body parts in parallel with disarmingly vibrant tropes on love and flora, Monique Wittig so trenchantly enters the body and creates a fathomless pharmacopoeia of love and healing.

			<p class="bright-text">A full-page urine color chart from physician and publisher Ulrich Pinder’s medical text, ‘Epiphanie medicorum’, printed in 1506 in Nuremberg, Germany. Medieval doctors in Europe used urine charts as diagnostic guide for all sorts of ailments. Some historians of medicine assume that the physicians of the Middle Ages also relied on their sense of taste and smell for medical identification. The taste and smell of a patient’s urine were affected by the illness they were suffering from, and generally corresponded with specific colors.

			<p class="bright-text">‘We are not, therefore, healed by simple anamnesis, any more than we are made ill by amnesia. Here as elsewhere, becoming conscious counts for little. The more theatrical and dramatic operation by which healing takes place - or does not take place - has a name:. transference. Now transference is still repetition: above all it is repetition. If repetition makes us ill, it also heals us; if it enchains and destroys us, it also frees us, testifying in both cases to its ‘demonic’ power. All cure is a voyage to the bottom of repetition. There is indeed something analogous to scientific experimentation in transference, since the patient is supposed to repeat the whole of his disturbance in privileged, artificial conditions, taking the person of the analyst as ‘object’. In transference, however, repetition does not so much serve to identify events, persons and passions as to authenticate the roles and select the masks.’
